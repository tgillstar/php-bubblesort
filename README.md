BubbleSort Simulation
===========

PROBLEM: Write a simulation of bubble sort algorithm using PHP.

------------

GOALS:

1. Develop a one‐page php‐based web application in functionality similar to the java applet on the screenshot. This application does not have to be the exact copy of the applet, only the elements described below are required.
2. The application should show every step of the bubble‐sort algorithm for a vector containing 10 integer numbers.
3. There should be two buttons on the page: Shuffle and Step.
    i. Shuffle button should initialize the array with 10 random integers between 0 and100.
    ii. Step button performs a single step of the sorting algorithm and displays it on the web page.
4. The array should be presented as a table with 10 rows (not columns like in the applet
above). Each row would include a rectangle colored with a color of your choice. The width of the rectangle would be proportional to the number stored in the corresponding array cell.
5. Every time the Step button is pressed, two numbers are compared and possibly swapped. The rectangles representing these two numbers should be highlighted using colors different from the color of all the other rectangles.
6. Consecutive clicking on the step button should eventually sort the array so that the largest number (the widest rectangle) will be at the top of the page (the first row in the table) and the smallest number (the narrowest rectangle) will be in the last row of the table.
7. Once the array is sorted, the Step button should either be disabled or hidden or from the user. When the Shuffle button is clicked again, the Step button will be reenabled.
8. All the processing needs to be done on the server side.
9. Make it as presentable and user‐friendly as possible.
